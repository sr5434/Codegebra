# Codegebra
A math software that can solve equations, find derivatives, and more.
## Motivation
I created this so that I could learn how systems like Matlab and Mathematica solve equations. However, I continued
to add more features after reaching my initial goal.
## Commands
Note that commands are case-sensitive.
 - ```SOLVE```: solve linear, quadratic, and exponential equations. Exponential equations must be in simplest for this to work
 - ```DIFF```: Differentiate a function
 - ```SCALE```: Scale a vector
 - ```DOTPR```: Find the dot product of 2 vectors
 - ```ADDVEC```: Find the sum of 2 vectors
 - ```EIGVAL```: Find the eigenvalues of a matrix
 - ```TRANSP```: Transpose a matrix
 - ```FFT```: Run a Discrete Fourier Transform on a signal
 - ```IFFT```: Run an Inverse Fourier Transform on a signal
 - ```INTEGRATE```: Integrate a function
 - ```SUM```: The sum of a vector
 - ```AVG```: The average of a vector
## Matrices
Matrices are written in the following format:
```[1, 2, 3;4, 5, 6]```
The comma separates elements in the matrix, and the semicolon seperates rows.
